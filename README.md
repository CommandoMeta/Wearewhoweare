What is Commando Meta

As a Guild, we make use of open finances and gaming concepts in conjunction with blockchain and web3 development. Our organisation embraces and integrates the principles of play to earn/play and earn, Dao, Staking, yield farming, NFT, and circular economy.
Although we are initially fully integrated into the Axie Infinity ecosystem, our business and development model are open to expanding into other ecosystems that are aligned with the values of decentralization, free-market and shared economy as well as the transparency and accountability provided by distributed ledger technologies.
Our involvement in the crypto world dates back to 2015, though the idea of the Guild had been brewing since Q4 of 2021.
Although this guild was formed during the bear market without external funding, it has expanded from the ground up to have more than 150 Axies under its management.
